# AI Agent Team Directive: Laravel Docu-Course Platform (2030b.com)

**Project:** 2030b.com  
**Directive Version:** 2.0  
**Status:** ACTIVE - STRICT PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT

## 1. Executive Summary & Operational Protocol

This document is the single source of truth for all AI agents generating code for the `2030b.com` Laravel codebase. The objective is to produce a **production-ready, error-free (0 errors), and perfectly consistent** system.

**ðŸ”’ Absolute Rule: Hallucination is Forbidden.** All generated code **MUST** be derived directly from the specifications in the linked MD files. If a requirement is not explicitly stated, the agent **MUST NOT** invent it. Instead, the agent **MUST** signal a requirement gap using the mandated comment format: '// REQUIREMENT_GAP: [Clear description of the missing specification]'.

**Protocol for All Agents:**
1. **RECEIVE TASK:** (e.g., "Generate Models for Step 5").
2. **CONSULT THIS INDEX:** Locate all required specification files for the task.
3. **DOWNLOAD & PARSE:** Access and read all linked MD files. Cross-reference them.
4. **GENERATE CODE:** Output code that **strictly adheres** to the downloaded specifications.
5. **VALIDATE OUTPUT:** Review generated code against this directive's rules before final submission. Ensure tests are included.

> **Update: Laravel Breeze & Package Integration**
> 
> The platform now uses Laravel Breeze with Blade templates for authentication, along with comprehensive Spatie package integration, payment processing via Stripe and Binance, and robust testing frameworks including PHPUnit and Pest.

  * **Purpose:** Defines user personas, their goals, and the flow of interactions with the platform. Provides crucial business context.
  * **Agent Action:** **CONSULT FOR CONTROLLERS, SERVICES, AND POLICIES.** This file provides the "why" behind the code. Use it to inform method logic, access control rules (`Policies`), and the sequence of operations within `Services`. If a journey requires a "preview" step, ensure the corresponding Service and Policy have the required methods.

## 3. Agent Output Requirements

1. **Consistency:** Code style **MUST** be unified according to `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` (naming, formatting, patterns).
2. **Completeness:** Generate all related files for a task (e.g., Model + Migration + Factory + Seeder + Unit Test).
3. **Correctness:** Code must be syntactically perfect, compile-ready, and must implement the specs with **0 errors**.
4. **Validation:** Integrate validation logic from `APP_DTO.md` and `SECURITY_GUIDE.md` into all relevant classes (Form Requests, DTOs).
5. **Tests:** For every generated PHP class, you **MUST** generate a corresponding test file as mandated by `TESTING_GUIDE.md`.
6. **Business Logic Alignment:** Cross-reference `USER_JOURNEY_ANALYSIS.md` to ensure generated code facilitates the intended user flows.

> **Update: Laravel Breeze Integration Requirements**
> 
> All authentication-related code must integrate with Laravel Breeze's Blade templates. Use Breeze's authentication controllers as base classes and extend with custom functionality. Ensure Tailwind CSS classes are compatible with the existing Breeze styling.

## 4. Error Handling & Reporting Protocol

All agents must implement a standardized, silent error handling approach to ensure robustness on `2030b.com`.

**In `App\Exceptions\Handler.php`:**
```php
public function register(): void
{
    $this->reportable(function (Throwable $e) {
        // Silently log all exceptions with full context for debugging on 2030b.com
        \Log::error('System Error: ' . $e->getMessage(), [
            'exception' => $e,
            'url' => request()?->fullUrl(),
            'user_id' => auth()?->id()
        ]);
    });

    // Render user-friendly responses for common errors
    $this->renderable(function (NotFoundHttpException $e, $request) {
        if ($request->expectsJson()) {
            return response()->json(['message' => 'The requested resource was not found.'], 404);
        }
    });

    $this->renderable(function (AuthenticationException $e, $request) {
        if ($request->expectsJson()) {
            return response()->json(['message' => 'Unauthenticated.'], 401);
        }
    });
}
```

**In Application Code:**
- Use try-catch blocks for predictable, recoverable errors (e.g., third-party API failures).
- Use validation failures for user input errors.
- Use policy denials for authorization errors.
- Let all other exceptions be handled by the global handler.

**// REQUIREMENT_GAP Protocol:**
**Any deviation from the linked specifications, or any identified missing requirement, must be reported immediately using the following comment format. Do not invent solutions.**

```php
// REQUIREMENT_GAP: [APP_DTO.md] does not specify the validation rule for the `user_profile.bio` field length (max: 500?).
// REQUIREMENT_GAP: [USER_JOURNEY_ANALYSIS.md] describes a refund process but no `RefundService` is defined in [APP_MODEL.md].
// REQUIREMENT_GAP: [APP_MODEL.md] defines a `Course::is_published` attribute but no matching column is in [DATABASE_SCHEMA_V2.md].
```

## 5. Task Assignment & Output Framework

Agents will be assigned tasks based on the phases in `PROJECT_PROCESS.md`. Each task will require generating a bundle of 10-30 interconnected files.

**Example Task Bundle: "Generate Authentication Layer"**
* **Input:** Phase from `PROJECT_PROCESS.md`
* **Specs Consulted:** `APP_MODEL.md` (User), `APP_ENUM.md` (UserRole), `DATABASE_SCHEMA_V2.md` (users table), `SECURITY_GUIDE.md`, `API_GUIDE.md` (/auth endpoints)
* **Expected Output Bundle:**
  * `app/Models/User.php`
  * `app/Enums/UserRole.php`
  * `app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`
  * `app/Http/Requests/Auth/LoginRequest.php`
  * `app/Http/Requests/Auth/RegisterRequest.php`
  * `app/Http/Resources/UserResource.php`
  * `app/Policies/UserPolicy.php`
  * `app/Services/AuthService.php`
  * `tests/Feature/Auth/LoginTest.php`
  * `tests/Feature/Auth/RegisterTest.php`
  * `database/factories/UserFactory.php`
  * `database/seeders/UserSeeder.php`

> **Update: Executed Migration Integration**
> 
> The following migrations have been executed and must be considered when generating related models and services:
> - `0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table.php` (Laravel/Breeze)
> - `0001_01_01_000001_create_cache_table.php` (Laravel)
> - `0001_01_01_000002_create_jobs_table.php` (Laravel)
> - `2025_08_29_211228_create_media_table.php` (Spatie MediaLibrary)
> - `2025_08_29_211330_create_permission_tables.php` (Spatie Permission)
> - `2025_08_29_211413_create_personal_access_tokens_table.php` (Laravel Sanctum)
> - `2025_08_29_211552_create_telescope_entries_table.php` (Laravel Telescope)
> - `2025_08_29_211842_create_activity_log_table.php` (Spatie ActivityLog)
> - All related Spatie package tables as documented in composer.json

## 6. Inter-Agent Communication Protocol

To maintain consistency when generating interconnected bundles, agents must adhere to these communication standards:

**1. Public Method Signatures:** When a service method is used across domains, its signature must be consistent.
```php
// In App\Services\PaymentService.php
/**
 * @param \App\DTOs\CreatePaymentData $paymentData
 * @return \App\Models\Payment
 * @throws \App\Exceptions\PaymentFailedException
 */
public function processSubscriptionPayment(CreatePaymentData $paymentData): Payment
{
    // Implementation...
}
```

**2. Shared DTOs:** DTOs defined in `APP_DTO.md` are immutable contracts. All agents must use them exactly as defined.

**3. Event Hooking:** Agents must leave clear hooks for future features based on `USER_JOURNEY_ANALYSIS.md`.
```php
// In App\Services\CourseService.php
public function publishCourse(Course $course): void
{
    $course->update(['status' => CourseStatus::PUBLISHED]);
    
    // HOOK: For future analytics integration
    // Event::dispatch(new CoursePublished($course));
    
    // REQUIREMENT_GAP: [USER_JOURNEY_ANALYSIS.md] mentions email notifications but no spec exists for NotificationService
}
```

## 7. Validation Checklist Before Submission

Every agent MUST run this checklist before submitting generated code:

- [ ] **âœ“ All generated files reference the correct specifications** (e.g., "Based on DATABASE_SCHEMA_V2.md v1.2")
